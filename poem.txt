sample death
enter void
in this moment, to myself, I do not exist

always black yet every colour I can think of comes to life here
empty yet so full of life

comfortable yet I am unconcious 
to enjoy feeling numb
to enjoy something you've never witnessed
something I do every night but still havent seen it with my own eyes

memories 
imagine
who where what
wow
only to forget everything the instant I wake
