sampling death
submerged in void
in this moment, to myself, I do not exist

finding comfort in being unconcious 
to enjoy feeling numb
to enjoy something you've never witnessed
something I do every night but still havent seen it with my own eyes

full of emptiness
always black yet every colour I can think of comes to life here

memories surface and recreate themselves
only to be discarded
an uncontrollable imagination
a remix of concepts
a rewite of history
a repeat of nightmares
who where what wow

only to forget everything the instant I wake
rinse and repeat
