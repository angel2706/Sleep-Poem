a taste of death
submerged in void
in this moment, to myself, I do not exist

Solely finding comfort in being unconcious 
again
and again
Yet I havent seen it with my own eyes
to enjoy something you've never witnessed
to enjoy feeling numb

overflowing with emptiness
stained black yet every colour breathes life here
painting a concoction of everything able to exist 

these unfamiliar memories 
collide with an uncontrollable imagination
a remix of concepts
a rewite of history
a repeat of nightmares
who where what wow

only to be forgotten
rinse and repeat
