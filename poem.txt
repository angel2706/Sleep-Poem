A taste of death
Submerged in void
In this moment, to myself, I do not exist

Losing consciousness 
Finding comfort without it 
Again
And again
Yet I havenâ€™t seen it with my own eyes
To enjoy something you've never witnessed
To enjoy feeling numb

Overflowing with emptiness
Stained black yet every colour breathes life here
Painting a concoction of everything able to exist 

These unfamiliar memories 
Collide with an uncontrollable imagination
A remix of concepts
A rewrite of history
A repeat of nightmares

An entire universe was created
Only to be forgotten
