sample death
enter void
in this moment, to myself, I do not exist

so comfortable yet I'm unconcious 
to enjoy feeling numb
to enjoy something you've never witnessed
something I do every night but still havent seen it with my own eyes

always black yet every colour I can think of comes to life here
full of emptiness

memories surface and recreate themselves
only to be discarded
an uncontrollable imagination
a remix of concepts
a rewite of history
a repeat of nightmares
who where what
wow

only to forget everything the instant I wake
